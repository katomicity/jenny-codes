we first handle the 2*3 and the 10/5 in the order of left to right
then we handle a 5+6 from the left and its soln is then subtracted ie. 11-1 which is the immediate right
then what remains is a 10+2 which gives us a 12 the main point is moving left to right and while operating on one operator at a time or two if not
